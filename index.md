### [Emora Chatbot: Winner of Amazon Alexa Prize 3](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexaprize/assets/challenge3/proceedings/Emory-Emora.pdf)

I was the co-team-lead for Emory University's 14-person student team participating in the 3rd Amazon Alexa Prize. The goal of this challenge was to develop the most engaging and capable dialogue agent. We were one of 10 teams invited to participate based on our proposal, out of approximately 400 applicants. The competition lasted from August 2019 to July 2020, in which we developed and deployed our chatbot Emora to Amazon Alexa Devices that any user could connect to. In July 2020, we won this year's competition, advancing through two elimination rounds based on user ratings and then receiving the highest overall rating from the panel of final invited judges.

As co-team-lead, I held weekly meetings with Amazon to present our team's progress and coordinate team functions within the schedule of the competition. I also planned and designed the Emora's overall vision and design in collaboration with the other team lead, as well as input from the rest of the developers on the team. I was responsible for multiple dialogue topic handlers, creating conversational flows for topics including science fiction and teleportation, family/work/school-life, and pets.

<b>Code for running the winning Emora is available at the [Emora Github Repository](https://github.com/emora-chat/emora_ap3_parlai).</b>

### Article QABot using Generative AI

My internship at Got It AI focused on the development of an article-grounded conversational question-answering dialogue system that ingests online FAQ documents in order to offer customer support. I was hired at the very inception of this idea to explore the best path forward for achieving this technological vision, and I led the development and execution of this project, under the supervision of my supervisor. I worked on the evaluation and integration of numerous approaches to dialogue-relevant tasks into the dialogue system, including information-retrieval, hallucination-detection, and response generation, focusing on prompt-based large language model approaches.

An example prompt Article QABot uses to generate a response for user input "can I apply the morning glow serum at night?"
